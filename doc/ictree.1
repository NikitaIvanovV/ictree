.TH ICTREE 1

.SH NAME
ictree - like tree but interactive
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY ictree
.OP1 OPTION
.OP FILE
.YS
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR ictree
is a terminal-based program that takes a list of contents of directories and displays them in a pager similar to
.IR less
where you can fold/unfold directories and quickly jump between them.
.PP
It is useful to browse
.IR locate , \ find
or any other program output that is a list of paths.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-fold ,\  \-f
Fold directories by default.
.PP
.TP
.BR \-\-separator=<C> ,\  \-s\ <C>
Set directory separator to C.
.B /
is the default value.
.PP
.TP
.BR \-\-help ,\  \-h
Print a help message and exit.
.PP
.TP
.BR \-\-version ,\  \-v
Display version information and exit.
.
.SH EXAMPLES
Find something with
.IR locate
and pipe output into
.BR ictree :
.IP
.EX
locate something | ictree
.EE
.PP
The same applies to any program that can produce a list of paths.
For example, one can use
.IR find
with
.BR ictree
to view current working directory in a nice tree-like format:
.IP
.EX
find | ictree
.EE
.PP
.BR ictree
can also take a file that contains paths as its first argument:
.IP
.EX
locate something > list.txt
ictree list.txt
.EE
.PP
.BR ictree
supports
.IR vi -like
search functionality.
Extended regular expressions are supported.
If a pattern contains
.B /
character, the search is performed by full paths of items instead of their short names in the list.
.

.IR less

.SH CUSTOM COMMANDS
It's possible to define custom commands in the configuration file (see
.IR FILES )
to open a selected path in other programs.
.PP
Examples:
.IP
.EX
# open selected path in vim by pressing e
map e vim "$f"
.IP
# open selected path in a pager
# defined in $PAGER environment variable
map i $PAGER "$f"
.EE
.PP
When a custom command is invoked,
.BR ictree
simply runs a program with
.IR /bin/sh
and sets
.BR $f
variable to whatever a user has selected.
.PP
Note: unlike
.IR Vim ,
it's impossible to use more than one character in a mapping.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ictree/config
Configuration file.
If
.B $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
